* RMSbolt

A basic implementation of the [[https://github.com/mattgodbolt/compiler-explorer][godbolt compiler-explorer]] for Emacs.

RMSBolt tries to make it easy to see what your compiler is doing. It does this
by showing you the assembly output of a given source code file. It also
highlights which source code a given assembly block corresponds to, and vice
versa.

* Why RMSbolt over godbolt?

- No more sending your code to any server
- Much faster turnaround time from writing code to seeing and interacting with disassembly
- 100% usable without the mouse.
- Write, compile, and view dissasembly entirely in Emacs
  - Use compile.el, flymake, or flycheck to traverse and fix errors as you
    would normally.
  - Use any libraries on your machine trivially
- Runs entirely without node, npm, or js.
  - No dependencies other than emacs 25 and your compiler ~:)~
  - Code is actually readable
- Full undo (tree) system from Emacs on disassembly for easy comparisons
- Infinitely hackable!

* Installation

rmsbolt will almost certainly not work on windows.

rmsbolt is not on melpa yet. If you find it useful, please let me know and I may
add it..

** Quelpa

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (quelpa '(rmsbolt
            :files (:defaults "starters")
            :fetcher gitlab
            :repo "jgkamat/rmsbolt"))
