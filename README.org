* RMSbolt

A basic implementation of the [[https://github.com/mattgodbolt/compiler-explorer][godbolt compiler-exporter]] for Emacs.

* Why RMSbolt over godbolt?

- No sending your code to a third party server
- Compilation runs entirely on your machine
- Better turnaround time from writing code to seeing disassembly
- Infinitely hackable!
- Write, compile, and view dissasembly entirely in Emacs
  - Use compile.el to traverse errors like you would normally
- Runs entirely without node, npm, or js.
  - No dependencies other than emacs 25 and your compiler ~:)~
